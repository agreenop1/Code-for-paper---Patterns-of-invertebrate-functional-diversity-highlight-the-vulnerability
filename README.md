Trait_processing – This script was used to turn the raw traits into synthetic traits using principle coordinate analysis and needs to be run first. It also transforms the occupancies into a list format that was used to calculate the diversity measures. Note, for aquatic functions and pollination the trait resolution columns needs to be removed before any analysis. 
Diversity_calculations – This script was used to calculate all the diversity measures used in the manuscript. Be aware of very long computing times (several hours to days) if this script is run on a single core (ideally needs to be run on a high performance computing cluster). Much of the code utilised in this script is based on code in the BAT and hypervolume packages (Cardoso et al., 2015; Blonder, 2018; Mammola & Cardoso, 2020). 
Paper_outputs – This script was used to process and calculate summary statistics for all the diversity trends. It also includes code to produce the figures found in the manuscript.

Trait files
AQUA_ET – Aquatic functions effects traits (csv)
•	4 traits with each level split into individual columns with species affinity fuzzy coded
•	For 79 species the traits are at the genus level and 13 at the species level. This is indicated in trait_resolution column.
POLL_ET – Pollination effects traits (csv)
•	9 traits – either categorical or continuous. 
•	For some of the species time on flower, nectar foraging, pollen foraging, stigma contact and dry pollen on the body were assigned at genus level. This is indicated in trait_resolution column.
PECO_ET – Pest control effects traits (csv)
•	4 traits – continuous, categorical or binary
PEST_ET – Pest effects traits (csv)
•	3 traits – continuous or categorical
